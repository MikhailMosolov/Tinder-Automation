# Tinder-Automation
As I believe, the script is an improved version of Adithya Reddy's project.
This version helps to send template messages to matches not yet being in correspondence.
Your tinder auth-token can easily be picked through inspecting profile XHR headers.
And your id can be found in preview section.

So far "liker" script works only to match everyone.
